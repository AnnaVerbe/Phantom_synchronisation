# Phantom manual synchronisation with infrared leds

## Contents
- synchronization of two camera phantoms : settings, electric circuit, and parameters
- Operating system: windows 10 
- Software used: PCC 3.4
- Phantoms cameras: Phantom Miro M11O, Phantom VEO E310

## How it's works: 
1. Triggering of VEO camera by fly falling in the field of the camera 
2. Triggering of the two infrared LEDs
3. Triggering of Miro camera by the led in the camera field 
4. Manual synchronization with the lighting of the LEDs (one led in each field of view/ two cameras)

## Step 1: Connect your computer to the phantoms
- You will need two ethernet ports for the two cameras or one ethernet port + a USB/ethernet adapter
- Connect the two cameras to the ethernet ports. 
- Go to Settings > Network & internet
- Find bellow "Advanced network settings" > Network and Sharing center 
- In the panel to the left find "Change adapter settings"
- This is here you will change the ethernet settings of both cameras to connect them to your computer. You will need the IP adress of both cameras.
- Double click on the ethernet connection you want to modify (if you don't know which camera corresponds to which ethernet port plug and connect the cameras one by one). This will open the windows: "Ethernet properties".
- Find "Protocole Internet version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and double clic. Clic on "Use the following IP address:" and complete the three lines with the IP address of your camera. It should look something like this [screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100707728/156538293-bd518ba3-276e-48d5-8bc5-71dbf7e93030.png). Click "Ok"
- Do the same thing for the other camera. 

## Step 2: Install and open PCC
